Project: Vote System

As this project works in the Local Area Network

You must configure the firewall of the System which is gonna be act as a Server.
Without Configuration of Firewall, other systems(client) cannot connect to the Main Server(Local Server)

To configure firewall,

See the Below Web Sites,
How to Setup Firewall Configuration, Links (In case of doubt)

Link 1: (Recommended)
https://finerdp.com/blog/windows_firewall_add_new_rule_windows_server_2022

Link 2:

When you come across Protocols and Port Tab/Page,

Put 80,443 in the Specific Local Ports Field

80 - http
443 - https

80 alone is enough though.

If any doubt Just Select Allow All Ports

Give a Meaningfull Name to the Rule Name 
Eg:(Allow Port 80)
Description:
SXC Vote System Local Port Configuration (Optional)

That's it.. Click Next the rule would be created.

Then restart the XAMPP server if already Started.
Else Start Now.


To Find the IP Address... 

Go to Windows Terminal (Command Prompt)

Type 'ipconfig'

There you can see various connections.

As in SXC all are connected to LAN via Ethernet
See the Ethernet Section

there you may find ipv6 Address
ipv4 address

ipv4 addess is the address we need

Copy the address

Eg:
192.68.76.115

Type this address in the other system's browser

http://192.68.76.115/Vote_System 

or simply

192.68.76.115/Vote_System 

See whether it is working.

If not or couldn't find the problem... contact Project Developer.

For Verification whether all systems are connected

see the First three Values of IPV4(GateWay)

192.68.76.

Every system connected to the Same Network have this as Same (mostly).


To remove firewall rule after Election

Just click on the rule and in actions tab right side, you can delete/remove it easily.
