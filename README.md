# Vote System
Developed by **MUTHUKRISHNAN M**
The **Vote System** is a web-based application designed for college elections with multiple voting booths connected via a LAN network. This system allows booth staff to select criteria and proceed to vote if the poll is active, while admins manage polls and view live results.

## Project Overview
- **Multiple Voting Booths**: Booths connected through the same LAN network, with no login required for booth staff.
- **Criteria Selection**: Staff select criteria such as shift or gender before proceeding to vote.
- **Admin Control**: Admins can start and end polls, and perform CRUD operations on positions, candidates, and other admins.
- **Live Ballot**: Admins and viewers can see live polling results with viewer credentials created by the admin.
- **Data Migration**: Master admins can migrate current election data to an old table and reset tables for the next election cycle.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Displays multiple post cards with dynamic updates on total candidates and total votes once the poll has started.
- **Master Admin Actions**: Master admins can start (restart if ended accidentally) and end the poll, add/delete/restrict other admins, and delete votes, candidates, and positions tables with a single button. Deleting the poll returns it to the initial stage.
- **Print Features**: Print winners and all results with candidate image, college logo, and details after the poll ends, available for all officials (admin, sub-admin, viewer).
- **Live Ballot Notifications**: Toast notifications appear when the server goes offline and persist until it comes back online.
- **Position Status**: Indicates whether a candidate is unopposed, no contestants, or opposed. Unopposed candidates don't receive votes and are not shown in the live ballot but are visible in print marked as unopposed.
